The "How Busy Is Toon" project was a unique experience for me for a variety of reasons.

Firstly, I was the sole developer on this project, which was the first one I undertook for Hedgehog Lab. This project began as a contract but eventually led to a full-time position. Naturally, this was an exciting but nerve-wracking assignment.

Secondly, this project gave me the opportunity to learn and implement the Jamstack architecture, using Gatsby and Contentful. The site was built using the atomic design methodology, which allows for the development of complex, robust interfaces by combining smaller and simpler components. This methodology played a crucial role in structuring the application and improving its maintainability.

Thirdly, I also took the initiative to research into datasets that could be incorporated into the information hub, a key part of the project. This involved setting up the account for Emoticon and creating detailed documentation on how the site was run and structured. The documentation also included a breakdown of how to use Contentful and the CMS tree.

Finally, my primary goal with this project was not only to meet its business requirements but also to create a site architecture that could be extended to other city councils. I dedicated significant time and effort into ensuring the site was developed according to best practices and with a focus on handover to future developers. This approach ensured that the application we built could continue to evolve and adapt to new needs and contexts beyond the initial scope of the project.

The experience taught me a great deal about project management, initiative, and the importance of thorough documentation and forward-thinking design in web development.`;

const challenges = `

As a Web Developer, it's common to encounter various challenges across different projects. Here are instances where I faced significant obstacles and the approaches I used to overcome them:

ISF Supplychain Project:

The ISF project involved building a list of widgets, each introducing a new SVG image, component, and block of text. As the list of widgets grew, it became necessary to reformat the code to make it easier, quicker, and more consistent for adding new widgets. Initially, I utilized object mapping as the method to render widgets on the page. However, as the list lengthened, we experienced performance issues due to unhandled re-rendering. Even after managing these unnecessary renderings, we continued to face performance issues.

The challenge was that the object mapping of a large amount of data did not function well. My solution involved creating a memoized version of the entire list. At first, I planned on using the useMemo hook for memoization, but I ran into issues when trying to use the hook outside of the component. Given that this needed to be a constant state, I implemented manual memoization by saving it to the cache and then retrieving it. This significantly improved the site's performance. Without this solution, the continued development of the project would have been challenging.

Halo Solutions Project:

The Halo Solutions project presented different challenges. We encountered scalability issues with certain areas of the application, mainly where lists were becoming too long. To mitigate this, I proposed the implementation of pagination. This solution proved efficient in handling long lists, ensuring smooth functionality, and enhancing the user experience. The process taught me valuable lessons in scalability and efficiency, emphasizing the importance of anticipating potential issues in the early stages of development and proactively addressing them.

COTY Project:

The COTY project posed a unique set of challenges, largely due to the age of the code base. It was outdated, which led to multiple complications throughout the project. The first solution I implemented was upgrading from webpack version 3 to webpack version 4. This update was necessary to improve compatibility and maintainability with newer JavaScript features and concepts.

Another major hurdle we faced was with a feature we introduced called 'visibility share.' Towards the end of its implementation, we realized that the amount of data we were dealing with was much larger than initially expected. This led to slow testing endpoints, which significantly hampered the user experience. To address this, I suggested breaking down the data and making more API calls with smaller data sets. This change resulted in a smoother user experience.

In a turn of events, I was invited to Heathrow to get firsthand user feedback. The main takeaway from this experience was the need to enhance the mobile experience and make the website available offline, converting it into a Progressive Web App (PWA). The irony was that the increased API usage, while smoothing the user experience, also complicated the implementation of offline capabilities. Nevertheless, these challenges provided me with opportunities to innovate and improve the overall product while enhancing my problem-solving skills.

CMSPI Project:

The CMSPI project was overall a successful one, with the product being delivered well ahead of schedule. This led to the creation of a retain team, marking a significant achievement for our company. However, during the development phase, we encountered issues with work efficiency, particularly due to our initial use of react query and resort validation. In retrospect, we created more work for ourselves than was necessary.

For instance, we manually created Zod schemas, whereas we could have automated this process using swagger. Additionally, I found the need to define a use query in each file repetitious and time-consuming. The lessons learned from this project were not implemented until the next project, the Caroline Girvan web app.

I wanted to explore a solution that didn't rely on Session storage, due to its potential management complexities. React context appeared to be an interesting alternative, but it presented its own challenges, particularly in terms of defining types. This is where my proficiency in understanding different libraries and problem-solving skills came in handy.

To overcome this hurdle, I essentially had to recreate a Redux-like solution using React Context. This involved identifying and defining the necessary types, a task that took considerable time and effort. It was a challenging process but also an enriching learning experience.

As I continued to refine the solution, I eventually moved the state to the URL. This ended up being the best solution for this problem - it simplified the management of the dynamic page names and significantly cleaned up the code, making it easier to maintain.

In the end, I managed to build a functioning solution that met our project requirements. This experience has allowed me to deepen my understanding of React and Redux, and it reinforced my belief in the importance of exploring different methods and technologies to achieve the best solution. Moreover, it emphasized the value of iterative refinement in the development process, as the best solution may not always be the first one you implement.

Caroline Girvan Project

In the Caroline Girvan web app project, I implemented a react query helper function, which significantly reduced repetitive coding and made it quicker and easier to implement. This well-structured approach was especially beneficial for junior developers, who found it easier to grasp and work with. In this project, I also took on a mentoring role for a junior developer, with a focus on accessibility for developer experience. This experience helped me grow not just technically but also in terms of my leadership and mentorship skills.

How Busy Is Toon Project

The "How Busy Is Toon" project presented a unique set of challenges, which stemmed mainly from the fact that I was the only developer on the project. It was the first project I undertook for Hedgehog Lab, initially as a contract that later turned into a full-time position. This was a high-pressure situation, but it also offered a valuable learning opportunity.

The website was built using the Jamstack (Gatsby - Contentful) methodology, adopting the atomic design methodology and utilizing CSS modules. The first challenge was to quickly ramp up on this technology stack, as I had limited prior exposure to it. To overcome this, I fully immersed myself in learning and understanding these technologies, focusing on practical application rather than just theoretical understanding.

An important aspect of the project was researching and incorporating datasets into the information hub. I took the initiative to identify relevant data sources, set up an account for Emoticon, and integrate it into our system. To ensure smooth operations, I created detailed documentation outlining how the site was run and structured, including a breakdown of how to use Contentful and the CMS tree.

Finally, my ambition for this project went beyond just meeting its business requirements. I aimed to architect the site in a way that it could be extended to other city councils. Therefore, a key challenge was ensuring the scalability of the project and maintaining best practices. I focused on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. I also prioritized the developer handover process, ensuring that any future developers on the project would have a smooth transition.

In summary, this project was a challenging yet rewarding experience that allowed me to grow as a developer, hone my problem-solving skills, and gain valuable hands-on experience with new technologies.
